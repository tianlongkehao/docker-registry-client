## Overview

Talk to any docker registry from your Java Projects. 

The intention is to make this easy to use. If you have a Java Project which needs to talk to docker registry, this project might fit your needs. I'll add it to maven central so that you could import this into your project easily

## APIs implemented

All read APIs documented here(https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/registry_api/) are implemented

## TBD

Add support for write and delete
